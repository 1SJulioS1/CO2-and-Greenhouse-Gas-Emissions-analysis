# World CO2 Emission Dashboard

This project involves an interactive application that analyzes and visualizes CO2 emission data over time, focusing on different continents and emission sources. It utilizes Python and libraries such as pandas, panel, and hvplot to process and visualize the data.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, panel, hvplot
Project Description
This project centers around creating an interactive application for analyzing and visualizing CO2 emission data. The application is divided into several sections, each focused on a specific aspect of the data.

# Main Features

Data Reading and Preprocessing: Utilizes the pandas library to read and preprocess CO2 emission data from a CSV file.
Interactive Visualization: Uses the hvplot and panel libraries to create interactive visualizations of the data. The application allows filtering data based on the selected year and emission source.
Continent-wise Analysis: Provides insights into CO2 emissions across different continents over time.
Emission Source Analysis: Displays a comparison of CO2 emissions by emission source in specific countries.
Usage Instructions
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using the following command:

Copy code

```
pip install pandas panel hvplot
```

Execute the following to show the page

```
panel serve notebook.ipynb
```

# How It Works

The application loads and preprocesses the CO2 emission data.
It provides options to filter the data based on the selected year and emission source.
Interactive visualizations are generated that show CO2 emissions across different continents and emission sources.
Users can explore and analyze the data interactively to gain deeper insights into global CO2 emissions.
